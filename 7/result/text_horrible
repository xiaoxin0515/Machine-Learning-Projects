Horrible service, horrible customer service, and horrible quality of service!  Do not waste your time or money using this company for your pool needs.  Dan (602)363-8267 broke my pool filtration system and left it in a nonworking condition.  He will not repair the issue he caused, and told me to go somewhere else.  

Save yourself the hassle, there are plenty of other quality pool companies out there.  

Take care!

Horrible customer service!  Been with them over 2 years, and after staying with them during my last move they raised my bill almost double for the same services!  Sent two emails since I don't have time to call, not a single response. Will finally waste an entire night to call to cancel my service.

Went to Marca today to get a haircut and was given a great service both by front desk - customer service and by Georgia, girl who did my hair. I guess I got lucky with her as she has years of experience doing this job. She has excellent customer service skills and takes excellent care of her customers.
